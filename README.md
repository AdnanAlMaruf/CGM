# CGM


Description:

This is classic snake game using OpenGlut,C++. Here are some feature of this game:

1.Speed of Snake will be  increasing as you progress upper level.
2.Easy to learn, Hard to master it.


This game has all features that a classic snake game have.The only difference is that it is created by C++.It will work on all the browsers 
but work best when you use chrome or safari .If you want to play the you have to press S/s  to start the game. The directional keys are the
controller of this game. In order to know how this works you must have the idea about the language C++, ComputerGraphics, OpenGL. You can also try learning some algorithms in computer graphics from the following link, here is the link : https://www.gatevidyalay.com/dda-algorithm-line-drawing-algorithms/ The header files used : #ifdef APPLE #include <GLUT/glut.h> #else #include <GL/glut.h> #endif #include <stdlib.h> #include <math.h> #include<bits/stdc++.h> You must have Codeblocks installed in your computer. You must import freeglut in order to run your project. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NTMFedVhbccZ0KBrYXKptU_MD8LDbZdu/view?usp=drive_web&authuser=1 in this link you will know how to import freeglut in your codeblocks. Hope you will like my project. Happy Snaking……
